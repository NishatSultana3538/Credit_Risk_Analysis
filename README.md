# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Background
Data preparation, statistical reasoning are some important component of  machine learning. 

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Different techniques need to be employed  to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries are used to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we need to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we need to  use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we need to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Finally we need to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
